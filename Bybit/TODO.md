# Future - Future
* [x] Get the history of a future contract
* [x] Get all gaps between future contracts
* [x] Plot historical data of a future contract
* [x] Calculate order cost
* [ ] Make the y axis of the plot extentable (candles are squished)
* [x] Make optimization benchmark for pandas and lists
* [ ] Store in parquet files
* [ ] Implement the actual strategy for future arbitrage
* [ ] Information system to notify the user about status of positions
* [ ] Make a Kestra ETL pipeline to extract, transform and load data 24/7
* [ ] Visual: Create a simulation tool with historical data (plotly with features)
* [ ] Commands: Create the backend of the simulation tool (all calculations)
* [ ] Add error handling for requests (not a priority, just understand my code please)
* [ ] Change methods to handle other future contracts (not just BTCUSDC)
* [ ] Make subcomponents (simulation, data, strategy, notification, etc)
* [ ] Add a cursor to the plot to always have the date and price under the mouse
* [ ] Make a tendance of spread plot
* [ ] Make code generic enough to handle perpetual contracts (add a limit to the number of fetches)
